# Purpose
> To be able to spin up multiple development environments without
> having to reconfigure all the time
>  
> Note: this is a fragile process and currently is OS dependent. Currenly only testing and working with
> Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on Linode

## Warnings
   * This is a very fragile process only currently tested in a ubuntu 18.04 environment
   * Currently, there is no Xforwarding setup because I am working from a cygwin environment 

   * This will also update your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.
   * Your original can be obtained at /etc/sshd/sshd_config.orig
  
## Updating linode instance

    sudo apt install git
    git clone https://github.com/ParamagicDev/vps-setup.git ~/vps-setup
    sudo bash /path/to/vps-setup/linode.bash -u #{username} [-e] user@example.com

* -u specifies the home directory where everything will be installed, just in case its being run from root
* -e flag is optional for email

* Then run:

      heroku login

* Also, ensure to secure your server via /etc/ssh/sshd_config 

## Setup

* Not everything could be done via bash script 
* Ensure you go into your server and secure it properly via sshd_config

* For viewing apps over ssh, ensure to use 
    
      ssh -L <localport>:localhost:<remoteport> user@ssh.com

* At full speed it should look like: 
    
       ssh -L 9000:localhost:3000 user@remoteserver.com

* Alternatively, ngrok is installed via linode.bash 
    
      ngrok http <localport>

      ngrok http 3000 

* This will bring up a CLI to connect to for example localhost:3000 on the web  

* Also, to setup heroku, ensure to use: 

      heroku login
